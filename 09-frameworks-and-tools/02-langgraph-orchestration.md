# LangGraph Orchestration (Dec 2025)

LangGraph is the **de facto standard** for building stateful, multi-agent systems in late 2025. Unlike simple chains, LangGraph allows for **Cycles**, **State Persistence**, and **Human-in-the-Loop** interventions.

## The Graph Philosophy

In 2023, agents were "Black Boxes."
In 2025, agents are **Graphs**.
A graph consists of:
- **Nodes**: Python functions (The LLM, a tool, or data processing).
- **Edges**: Paths between nodes.
- **Conditional Edges**: Logic that determines the path based on the **State**.

## Cyclic vs. Acyclic

Standard LangChain is **Acyclic** (Sequential).
LangGraph is **Cyclic**.
- **The Power of the Loop**: An agent can try a tool, see the error, and **cycle back** to the "Thinking" node to try again. This is the foundation of the **ReAct** pattern.

---

## State Management

The **State Schema** is the "Mind" of the graph.
```python
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    plan: list[str]
    is_secure: bool
```
**Nuance**: Using `Annotated` with `add_messages` allows the graph to **Append** to history rather than overwriting it, preserving the full reasoning trajectory.

---

## Persistence and Checkpointing

Late 2025 LangGraph uses **Thread-based Persistence**.
- **The Concept**: Every session has a `thread_id`.
- **The Win**: If a user comes back after 2 days, the agent remembers the exact point it was at in a multi-step workflow.
- **Time-Travel**: Developers can "re-run" a specific thread from a previous state to debug a failure.

## Multi-Agent Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Case Study |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Supervisor** | One "Manager" directs specialized workers. | Research Team |
| **Peer-to-Peer**| Agents hand off tasks to each other directly. | Customer Support |
| **Hierarchical**| Graphs within Graphs (Nested graphs). | Enterprise Engineering |

## Interview Questions

### Q: Why use LangGraph instead of OpenAI's "Assistant API"?

**Strong answer:**
**Control and Portability**. The Assistant API is a black box: you cannot see the exact prompts or control the logic gates. LangGraph is a **White Box framework**. I can use any model (OpenAI, Claude, Llama 3.3), control exactly when a tool is called, and inject my own custom validation logic between steps. More importantly, LangGraph is **Open Source** and can run locally/on-prem, which is critical for many enterprise security requirements.

### Q: How do you handle "State Overload" in a graph with 20+ nodes?

**Strong answer:**
We use **State Narrowing**. Instead of passing the entire global state to every node, we define specialized sub-states for sub-graphs. We also use **Trim Runnables** to prune the message history before it hits the LLM, ensuring we don't waste tokens while keeping the "Truth" preserved in the persistence layer.
